The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the Pony

Today is Earth Day.
I love Earth Day.
Purple rain
is not pink
is not orange either
Blue is cold
Teal
Green is calm
Brown
Indigo
Recycle!
Unicorn
Yellow
Red is hot
East or West Dannie is the best!
But never the twain shall meet

These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the rainbow coloured unicorn.
Pony:
Peter Pony drinks a cup of oolong tea.
It tastes wonderful.
There must have been some cicadas on those leaves, how lucky!
